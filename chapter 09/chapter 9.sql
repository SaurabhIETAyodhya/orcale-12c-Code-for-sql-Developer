---4 using group by 

SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES;
/*
ORA-00937: not a single-group group function
00937. 00000 -  "not a single-group group function"

SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
group by DEPARTMENT_ID  ; -- all columns in the select should appear in group by 

SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,job_id, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID,JOB_ID  -- all columns in the select should appear in group by
order by 1, 2 ; 

--this will retrive error , job_id also should be in group by 
--the error will be: not a GROUP BY expression
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,job_id, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID  
order by 1, 2 ; -- all columns in the select should appear in group by


--you can not make group by using alias 
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID d , SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY D;

--but you can make order using alias 
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID d , SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID
order by d;

--where and group by  and order by 
--where first then group by then order by 
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
where DEPARTMENT_ID>30
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID  
order by DEPARTMENT_ID ;
 
 
 --very important note, you can not use where to restrict groups
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
where SUM(SALARY)>156400 -- this not coorect , you should use having
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID  
order by DEPARTMENT_ID ;

--so use having 
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID  
having SUM(SALARY)>150000
order by DEPARTMENT_ID ;

--it could be using having before group by, but not recomnded

SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY)
FROM  EMPLOYEES
HAVING SUM(SALARY)>150000
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID  
order by DEPARTMENT_ID ;


---finaly
--you can make nested group function

SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID,sum(salary)
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID 
order by 1;

SELECT max(sum(salary)) --only 2 group functions can be nested 
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID 
order by 1;
